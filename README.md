## Quick Start

### Option 1: Release binaries

Download the latest build:
- https://github.com/ilyaux/Eve-flipper/releases

Release asset naming:
- Classic binary: `eve-flipper-windows-amd64.exe` (and `linux/darwin` variants)
- Wails desktop binaries: `eve-flipper-wails-windows-amd64.exe`, `eve-flipper-wails-linux-amd64`, `eve-flipper-wails-linux-arm64`, `eve-flipper-wails-darwin-amd64`, `eve-flipper-wails-darwin-arm64`

Run the binary and open:
- `http://127.0.0.1:13370`

### Option 2: Build from source

Prerequisites:
- Go `1.25+`
- Node.js `20+`
- npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ilyaux/Eve-flipper.git
cd Eve-flipper
npm -C frontend install
npm -C frontend run build
go build -o build/eve-flipper .
./build/eve-flipper
```

Windows PowerShell helpers:

```powershell
.\make.ps1 build
.\make.ps1 run
```

Unix Make targets:

```bash
make build
make run
```

### Option 3: Wails desktop variant (separate mode)

This mode keeps the existing runtime modes untouched (`Go embedded web app` and `Tauri`),
and adds an additional desktop build powered by Wails.

PowerShell:

```powershell
.\make.ps1 wails
```

Output:
- `build/eve-flipper-wails.exe`

Manual build equivalent:

```bash
go build -tags wails,production -ldflags "-s -w -H=windowsgui -X main.version=dev" -o build/eve-flipper-wails.exe .
```

Run directly:

```powershell
.\make.ps1 wails-run
```

Unix Make:

```bash
make wails
make wails-run
```

## Runtime Flags

```bash
./eve-flipper --host 127.0.0.1 --port 13370
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (`0.0.0.0` for LAN/remote access) |
| `--port` | `13370` | HTTP port |

## EVE SSO (Optional)

Many scanners work without login, but these features require EVE SSO:
- Character-aware fees/skills autofill
- Character orders/assets-based workflows
- Player structure market data and structure names
- Corporation dashboards/endpoints

Create `.env` in repo root for local/source builds:

```env
ESI_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
ESI_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
ESI_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:13370/api/auth/callback
```

Do not commit `.env`.

## Development Workflow

Backend:

```bash
go run .
```

Frontend dev server:

```bash
npm -C frontend install
npm -C frontend run dev
```

Tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Production frontend build check:

```bash
npm -C frontend run build
```

## Security Notes

- By default, server listens only on localhost.
- ESI credentials are optional for non-SSO features.
- If exposed beyond localhost (`--host 0.0.0.0`), use your own network hardening (firewall/reverse proxy/TLS).
